# Weight Calculation Formulas

This document describes formulas used for calculating different types of body weights in paediatric drug calculations.

## Ideal Weight Calculation
Calculates the ideal weight based on height (in centimeters):

Formula:

Ideal Weight = h² × 0.0005

where h is the height in centimeters.

## Adjusted Weight Calculation
Calculates the adjusted weight using the actual and ideal weights:

Formula:

Adjusted Weight = Ideal Weight + (Actual Weight − Ideal Weight) × 0.4

## Lean Body Weight Calculation (Devine Formula)
Calculates lean body weight using the Devine formula, based on weight (kg) and height (cm):

hₘ = h / 100
IBW = 50 + 2.3 × ((h − 152) / 2.54)
LBW = 1.1 × IBW − 128 × (IBW / hₘ)²
